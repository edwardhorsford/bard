# Variables

Variables are used to store values. They can be used to store a value of any
data type, such as String, Fixnum, Float, etc.

### Naming Conventions:
- Camel Case `variableName`
- Snake Case: `variable_name`

##### Examples

```ruby
variable_name = 5
```

```ruby
x = 15
```

```ruby
 y = 20
```

```ruby
x + y // 35
```
