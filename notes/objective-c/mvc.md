# Model-View-Controller

# Model Objects

These objects are the stored data, rules, logic, and process of the application. The model objects are manipulated by the controller object which in turn updates the view object.

# View Objects

View objects are what the users see. They allow the user to interact with and change the data within the application. They talk to the controller and display the model object's information.

# Controller Objects

These objects receive information from the view objects and manipulate the model objects.
