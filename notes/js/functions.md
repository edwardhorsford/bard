# Functions

```
var makeKittyPurr = function() {
	/* code to execute */
};
```

## Ways to declare

1. Assign to a variable
2. Anonymously (callback or immediate execution)
3. //

## Best Practices

* Should always return a value. This allows for method chaining. It may not seem necessary in the moment, but, as your project grows, you will see the value in this practice.
